# Worksapce_SCARA
This is a project to plot the workspace of the SCARA robot, with joint limits and a disk obstacle in the environment.
But to make life easier, only the collision between link 1 and obstacle is considered.
If there is a collision between the link 2 and the obstalce, there is no plot and return an error message.
The project is implemented with Matlab 2021b.
